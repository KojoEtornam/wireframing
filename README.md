                                                                       Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is an essential part of the design process that helps visualize the layout and structure of a website, application, or system before the actual development begins. It serves as a blueprint, outlining the key elements and functionalities in a simple and low-fidelity format.

                                                                          What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a skeletal representation of a user interface (UI) for a digital product. It typically includes basic shapes and placeholders for text, images, and other UI elements, without focusing on colors, typography, or detailed aesthetics. It aims to showcase the layout, structure, and functionality of the interface.

1. Clarifies the Design Concept: Wireframing helps designers, developers, and stakeholders align their vision by providing a clear structure of the interface.

2. Saves Time and Resources: By identifying issues early in the design process, wireframes help avoid costly changes later on, improving efficiency and reducing development time.

3. Enhances Collaboration: Wireframes act as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients, facilitating better collaboration and feedback.

4. User-Centered Design: Wireframing allows designers to focus on usability and user flow, ensuring that the final product meets the needs of the target audience.
